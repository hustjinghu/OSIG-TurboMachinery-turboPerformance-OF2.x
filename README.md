OSIG-TurboMachinery-turboPerformance-OF2.x
==========================================

This git repository was created Bruno Santos (wyldckat@github), based on the original files that are available here: svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/openfoam-extend/svn/trunk/Breeder_2.0/OSIG/TurboMachinery/src/turboPerformance

It has been created after finding this thread: http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-installation/83584-osig-turbomachinery-libraries-able-work-under-openfoam-1-6-ext-2.html

The official wiki page for this library is this one: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Sig_Turbomachinery_Library_turboPerformance

The original source code from the SVN repository mentioned above is designed to work with OpenFOAM 2.0.x and is also present in the branch `of20x` at this git repository.

This git repository aims to unofficially extend the ability to build this library with the more recent versions of OpenFOAM. The main objective is only to adapt the library to each of the currently unsupported OpenFOAM versions, such as 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Therefore, please keep in mind that the respective tutorials are not fully tested with each OpenFOAM version.
